Earth has the moon - quote of the day: 
    We're whalers on the moon,
    We carry a harpoon.
    But there ain't no whales
    So we tell tall tales
    And sing our whaling tune.


Not sure what this riddle is about. 
Blue moon, white whale, Moby Dick...

This beautiful blue ball is flat, probably. Just ask Kyrie, he went to Duke. 

Whalers: reminds me of gambling
